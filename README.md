# HDL_based_design

Coursework for the course HDL based design in University of Turku.

1. BCD-to-bar
A simple program which converts binary coded decimal into bar graph

2. Tally counter
Another simple program which takes three 2bit vectors from "judges", calculates
the amount of votes and outputs a 2bit vector as a result

3. Universal 4bit counter
A simple 4bit counter

4. Universal 8bit counter
Another counter from 00 to FF. First coursework with multiple processes.

5. A state machine for driving an RGB led on a Xilinx FPGA
This is the first coursework to be implemented on the Digilent Zybo Z7-20 board.
Includes a separate timer module and 3 inputs (+ reset) to change the blinking
behavior. "led_board" is the final version including the board implementation.

6. Temperature alarm
A program that monitors an analog sensor and utilizes a buzzer to notify of
too high or low temperatures.
